- **LOG-3** ✓ Dossier table structure  
  Location: `shared/schema.ts:1197-1214`  
  Fields: session_id, safety_score, feedback_score, CRS, crs_json, review_status

### Governance
- **GOV-1** ✓ Support policy admin-toggled channels  
  Location: `shared/schema.ts:1236-1245`  
  Toggles: enable_email_support, enable_chat_support, enable_phone_support (default: OFF)

- **GOV-4** ✓ Transparency & explainability  
  Location: `server/ai-moderation.ts:346-357`  
  CRS JSON includes formula, components, calculation breakdown

### Support Configuration
- **FB-1** ✓ Structured feedback channel with admin toggles  
  Location: `shared/schema.ts:1236-1245` (supportConfig table)  
  Database-backed toggles for email, chat, phone support

- **FB-2** ✓ Independent support toggle control  
  Location: `shared/schema.ts:1238-1240`  
  Each toggle operates independently with default OFF

## ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (3 Requirements)

### AI Moderation
- **SA-9** ⚠️ False positive review (admin override)  
  **Status:** Admin review queue exists, but whitelist/learning loop not found  
  **Action Required:** Implement admin override to mark content as benign and add to subject-specific whitelist

### Post-Class Processing
- **PC-5** ⚠️ Admin review card with redacted media clips  
  **Status:** Admin review UI exists (`client/src/pages/admin/moderation-review.tsx`), but no redacted media clips (≤30s, blurred/bleeped/masked)  
  **Action Required:** Implement secure media clip generation, redaction (blur/bleep/mask), and signed URL access

### Teacher Actions
- **TA-1** ⚠️ Teacher review notification banners  
  **Status:** Moderation status page exists (`client/src/pages/teacher/moderation-status.tsx`), but no specific "one of your classes was selected for review" banner  
  **Action Required:** Add one-time daily banner notification when teacher has queued session

### Feedback System
- **FB-5** ❌ Nightly NLP feedback analysis batch job
